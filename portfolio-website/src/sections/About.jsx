      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p style={{ maxWidth: "800px", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        I am an early-career Data Science and AI/ML professional with a strong
        foundation in Python, SQL, machine learning, and data analytics. I have
        hands-on experience working on end-to-end projects involving data
        preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering,
        model building, evaluation, and deployment.
      </p>

      <p style={{ maxWidth: "800px", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        My academic background and project work span healthcare analytics,
        computer vision, business intelligence dashboards, and cloud-based data
        solutions. I enjoy turning raw data into meaningful insights and building
        scalable, data-driven systems.
